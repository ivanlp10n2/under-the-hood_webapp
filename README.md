# under-the-hood_webapp

The main idea is to show up how a java app is developed without any framework, only java Core.

Later I'll be using Spring framework for other projects (such as REST apps and so on) 

Hope you find this useful for your future projects. 

Please feel free to fork, I'll be glad to hear some tips and build a better app.
